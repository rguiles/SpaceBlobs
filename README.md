# BlobBots
Software Engineering group project for Spring 2020.

# Introduction 
For our Software Engineering class project, we decided to do a twist on a game called Tontie. 
This is a web browser game that utilizes the NUM PAD for the controls. It's a simple "wack-a-mole" style game.

Here is a link to what the gameplay looks like - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx3FcuVG2ZM&feature=youtu.be

# Instructions 
In order for this game to work, you will need to download a zip file of this repo and extract it to a folder. 
Then in your Command Prompt, change to the directory where the index.html file is located from the zip file. 
Finally you will this code:

python -m http.server

When running this code you should see something like this -
Serving HTTP on :: port # (http://[::]:#/) ...

This will allow you to create a server from your localhost on your browser. 
Next, open up your broswer and type in "localhost:port#" into the url bar. 
Make sure to replace "port#" with the number you see when you run the code.
